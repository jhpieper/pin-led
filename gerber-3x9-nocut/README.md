I have ordered this design from JLCPCB, but no warranties are made about 
the correctness of these files.  Use at your own risk.

IMPORTANT:  This design requires you to cut the pcb apart afterwards. 
            Getting a clean cut for these small boards is quite difficult
            without proper tools.  I found that a 4inch mini table saw with
            a diamond blade works well.

The benefit of this design is that it fits more led boards compared to the 
stamphole version (27 vs. 21) and doesn't require extra cutting costs.  

Estimated costs for five pcbs (135 led boards) as of March 2021:
