When I tried to order this design from JLCPCB, I was told that there would be a
surcharge of $12 because of excessive routing required for this design.

Estimated costs for five pcbs (105 led boards) as of March 2021:

PCBs                 $2
SMT Assembly        $20
SMT Discount        -$7
Extra Routing       $12
Shipping (cheapest)  $8
-----------------------
Total Estimate      $35
